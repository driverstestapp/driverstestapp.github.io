G1 Drivers Test App is not connected to the Ministry of Transportation, any DriveTest office or to any other agency or mechanism that administers, creates, processes or grades driving license or permit examinations. Our App contains general information regarding the G1 written/computerized knowledge test in Ontario, Canada for informational and educational purposes only. When we use the acronym “G1” we are not claiming to act on behalf of, nor that we are endorsed, sponsored or sanctioned by any governmental unit or authority. Where we make a definitive statement regarding the test or the motor vehicle laws or regulations in Ontario, we are referencing the official driver’s manual and/or motor vehicle laws. In rare instances, our interpretation of the official driver’s manual’s wording may be inaccurate in some respect; you hereby recognize this fact and agree to always rely on the manual and laws as the final word on the official test materials. Our practice tests are intended for training and learning purposes only. We do not represent that you will get the same exact questions and answers on the official examination. The practice tests are intended to give you a good idea of what to expect and what to pay particular attention to while studying the driver’s handbook. The testing that we provide tries to follow as closely as possible the subject matter stressed in the driver’s handbooks but the actual test questions can never be assuredly predicted so that the client/customer agrees and acknowledges that the testing and learning techniques are helpful tools but they can never assure certain test questions or answers, nor a certain result on an official state examination.</p>
